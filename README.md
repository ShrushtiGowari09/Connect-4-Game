# Connect 4 Game

A modern and interactive version of the classic Connect 4 game, built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This game allows for both Player vs. Player (PvP) and Player vs. Computer (PvC) modes, with customizable player names, a restart button, and an exit button to return to the welcome page.

## Features

- **Player vs. Player (PvP) Mode**: Two players can compete against each other. Players can input their names, and the game will display whose turn it is as well as announce the winner by name.
  
- **Player vs. Computer (PvC) Mode**: Challenge the computer in a single-player mode. The player can input their name, and the computer will make random moves as the opponent.

- **Customizable Player Names**: Players can enter their names before starting the game. In PvC mode, only the player's name is required.

- **Dynamic Turn Display**: The game updates the display to show whose turn it is, with "Player 1" or the player's name for PvC mode and "Computer" when it's the computer's turn.

- **Winning Condition Alerts**: The game checks for horizontal, vertical, and diagonal connect-4 wins and alerts the players when someone wins.

- **Restart Button**: After a game ends, a restart button appears, allowing players to start a new game without refreshing the page. This button is located in the top-right corner of the screen.

- **Exit Button**: The game includes an exit button that allows players to leave the game and return to the welcome page (`welcome.html`). The button is positioned below the restart button in the top-right corner.

- **Responsive Design**: The game board and background adapt to different screen sizes, ensuring a consistent and enjoyable experience on mobile and desktop devices.

## How to Play

1. Choose your game mode (PvP or PvC) from the welcome screen.
2. Enter player names when prompted.
3. Players take turns clicking on the columns to drop their discs.
4. The game will announce the winner and display a restart button to play again.
5. Use the exit button to return to the welcome screen at any time.
